The health and lifespan of people change over time, and added stress from running in a political election affects that. Using 3,587 observations of political candidates from the paper "Longevity Returns to Political Office" by Barfort, Klemmensen & Larsen (2019), we aim to create a model for finding how long  candidates live after the election they run in.
